Unrecognized Blends in Operations Rehearsal 3
#############################################

.. abstract::

   Unrecognized blends are blended objects that are mistakenly identified as a single object, usually due to a high degree of overlap caused by ground based seeing. Using a space based catalog we can attempt to match objects between the two and identify any unrecognized blends. In this technote we use the truth catalogs as a proxy and create a simple matching algorithm between truth and observation to label recognized and unrecognized blends. We then see how the rate varies with object properties such as i-mag and local density.
